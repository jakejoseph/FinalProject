#Summary
This data visualization presents the weight, height and BMI of every Major League baseball player for whom Sean Lahman’s database contains height and weight records.   Player height and BMI are presented on the x and y axes respectively, and player weight is represented by the size of the player’s marker. Each player is plotted in their debut year from 1871 to 2015, and the average height, weight, and BMI for that year are plotted in red.  Viewers can see the historic average trends in height and BMI and then navigate to a specific year to get information about the players that debuted in that year.
