#Summary
This data visualization presents the weight, height and BMI of every Major League baseball player for whom Sean Lahman’s database contains height and weight records.   Player height and BMI are presented on the x and y axes respectively, and player weight is represented by the size of the player’s marker. Each player is plotted in their debut year from 1871 to 2015, and the average height, weight, and BMI for that year are plotted in red.  Viewers can see the historic average trends in height and BMI and then navigate to a specific year to get information about the players that debuted in that year.
#Design

##The message for the design
I began designing by examining the data regarding player’s weight and height, when I noticed that both height and weight of players continually increased since the start of Major League Baseball.  However, at about the 1990s, the weight started to increase more than the average increase in height.  I sketched a plot in R to measure the change in BMI over time, and this can be found in the project history folder.  It showed a dramatic increase in weight, but not height since the 1990s.  I wanted to capture this story, but I needed to be able to show: passage of time; weight; height; and BMI.  Since the story was about the BMI, I initially chose to put this on the x axis, with the height on the y axis.  I chose to show the passage of time by animation, and the weight by the size of the dot representing each player.
